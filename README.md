## Development server

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## About

This is a website I am developing for fun, as an inside joke with a few friends. Nothing in this repository is intended to follow good coding practice or good website design. The goal is to make the website look like a 2003 MySpace page by someone who is just learning what different html tags do.
